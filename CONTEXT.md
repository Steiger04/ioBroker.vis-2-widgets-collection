# JSON Table Collection Widget

The widget renders a JSON-valued ioBroker state as a table. Columns are auto-discovered from the data and individually configurable; each column's raw cell values are rendered according to a chosen format type. This glossary pins down the cell-rendering language shared across the analysis engine, the renderer, and the column editor.

## Language

**Column**:
A field of the table — either user-configured (`columnConfig`) or auto-discovered from the JSON data.
_Avoid_: Field, attribute (those mean vis-2 property-editor fields, not table columns)

**Raw value**:
The unmodified cell value coming from the JSON data, before any formatting or rendering.
_Avoid_: Cell value (ambiguous — could mean the rendered output)

**Format type**:
HOW a column's raw value is rendered. One of `number`, `date`, `boolean`, `string`, `image`.
_Avoid_: Render mode, display type

**Image column**:
A column whose format type is `image`. Each raw value is read as a *visual reference* and drawn as a graphic instead of text.
_Avoid_: Icon column — "icon" vs "image" is a value-level distinction, not a column type

**Visual reference**:
A string that resolves to a renderable graphic: a URL or file path, a `data:image/…` URI, or a short UTF-8 character (e.g. an emoji). A cell value is **never** an icon *name* (`mdi-*`, `fa-*`) — there is no name resolution in cell values.
_Avoid_: Image src, icon name

**Icon vs Image**:
A *per-value, runtime* distinction — never a config or column type, and not a tint gate. An **icon** is a small monochrome glyph (SVG data-URI or UTF-8 character); an **image** is a raster photo (png/jpg/webp/…). A configured colour tint applies to either, via a CSS mask over the source's alpha channel.
_Avoid_: Treating "icon" and "image" as separate column types or separate format types; assuming tint is icons-only.

**Fallback**:
What happens when a raw value cannot be resolved to a graphic in an image column: the cell renders the raw value as plain text. An empty value renders an empty cell; a broken URL renders a placeholder icon.
_Avoid_: Error state, invalid cell

**Detected type**:
The type inferred from the data by the analysis engine (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, `date`, `image`, `null`, `array`, `object`, `mixed`). Drives the default format type and the type badge shown in the editor's analysis panel.
_Avoid_: Format type (the detected type is a hint; the format type is the user's rendering choice and may differ)
